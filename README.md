### Package Information: episensr

- Title: Basic Sensitivity Analysis of Epidemiological Results
- Description: Provides tools for basic sensitivity analysis of observed relative risks, allowing adjustment for unmeasured confounding and misclassification of exposure and/or outcome. The package implements quantitative bias analysis methods described in: Lash TL, Fox MP, Fink AK. Applying Quantitative Bias Analysis to Epidemiologic Data. Springer, 2021.
